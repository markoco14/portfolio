Welcome to my portfolio. You can find information about all my past and current projects here, along with links to each project to play aorund. 

## Current Projects

*I was working on the Canary Bank project back in May 2021. When the Covid alert rose to level 3 in Taiwan, a friend of mine asked me to help build an information website for foreigners to stay up-to-date on Taiwan's Covid alert status. So, I put the Canary Bank project on hold to help build [covid-taichung.com](https://www.covid-taichung.com/). I had some downtime from Covid Taichung so I started working on the Teaching Dialogue Writing App as a project to learn RectJS. When I finish Teaching Dialogue v1.0 I will go back to the Canary Bank project.*

I'm currently working on 3 projects:

1. Teaching Dialogue Writing App
2. Covid Taichung Information Website (nearly complete, currently implementing map update)
3. Canary Bank Student Rewards Bank

## Past Projects

I've completed 2 projects from start to finish:

1. Taiwan Tax Calculator
2. Teacher's Whiteboard Lesson Planner
