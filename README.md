# Mark O'Connor

Welcome to my portfolio. You can find information about all my past and current projects here, along with links to each project. 

## Current Projects

*I was working on the Canary Bank project back in May 2021. When the Covid alert rose to level 3 in Taiwan, a friend of mine asked me to help build an information website for foreigners to stay up-to-date on Taiwan's Covid alert status. So, I put the Canary Bank project on hold to help build [covid-taichung.com](https://www.covid-taichung.com/).*

I'm currently working on 3 projects:

1. Teaching Dialogue Writing App (*project to learn ReactJS*)
2. Covid Taichung Information Website (*nearly complete, currently implementing map update*)


## Past Projects

I've completed 2 projects from start to finish:

1. Taiwan Tax Calculator (*currently doing a refactor*)
2. Teacher's Whiteboard Lesson Planner (*currently doing a refactor*)

## Future Projects

1. Canary Bank Student Rewards Bank (*On hold until Teaching Dialogue Writing App completed*)
    1. Project originally written using JS and PHP
    2. Will be redone using ReactJS
